## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass/SCSS
- Bootstrap
- jQuery/Javascript
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
  - Had the purple background set for the main element at first, but I could not get that to look right as it kept growing with the form content. When I changed it to apply to the header element it worked.
  -I added an error message when a user tries to add a blank task, as well as the ability to save updated tasks that are already in the list, also active gets updated when a user checks/unchecks a task.
  -for the checkbox tickmark I could apply a stackoverflow post (see link)
  - The use of js filter()
  - Amazon tutorial project helped with localStorage use


### Continued development

- Daily tutorials and projects in HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Bootstrap, Sass/SCSS. For now, in time I will go re-learn React ect.
